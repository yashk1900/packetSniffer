# **Real-Time Packet Sniffer - Design Document**

## **1. Overview**
A real-time packet sniffer is a network analysis tool that captures, inspects, and logs network packets. This tool provides visibility into network traffic, helping with debugging, monitoring, and security analysis. It is built using **C++** and **libpcap**, ensuring high performance and efficiency.

## **2. Objectives**
- Capture and analyze real-time network packets.
- Support multiple protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP, HTTP, etc.).
- Provide filtering options based on source/destination IP, port, and protocol.
- Offer live statistics for bandwidth usage and packet distribution.
- Implement a CLI for ease of use.

## **3. Architecture**
- **Packet Capture Module:** Uses libpcap to capture packets from the network interface.
- **Packet Parser:** Decodes Ethernet, IP, TCP/UDP headers, and extracts relevant metadata.
- **Filter Engine:** Allows filtering based on IP, port, and protocol.
- **Statistics Collector:** Tracks packet count, bandwidth, and protocol distribution.
- **CLI Interface:** Provides an interactive command-line utility for configuring and running the sniffer.

## **4. Technical Stack**
- **Language:** C++
- **Libraries:** libpcap (for packet capture), ncurses (for CLI visualization)
- **Concurrency:** Multi-threading with std::thread to handle packet capture and analysis simultaneously.
- **Data Structures:** Hash maps for tracking statistics, queues for buffering packets.

## **5. Implementation Plan**
### **Phase 1: Packet Capture (Week 1-2)**
- Setup libpcap to listen on a network interface.
- Capture raw packets and print basic details (timestamp, size, protocol).
- Implement packet buffering using a queue.

### **Phase 2: Packet Parsing (Week 3)**
- Extract Ethernet, IP, and TCP/UDP headers.
- Parse metadata (source/destination IP, port, packet size).
- Implement data validation and error handling.

### **Phase 3: Filtering and Statistics (Week 4)**
- Allow packet filtering based on protocol, IP, and port.
- Implement real-time statistics (packet count per protocol, bandwidth usage).
- Optimize memory usage and processing efficiency.

### **Phase 4: CLI Interface (Week 5)**
- Develop a command-line interface for users to configure filters and view statistics.
- Add real-time packet visualization using ncurses.
- Provide log file support for saving packet data.

## **6. Expected Outcome**
- A high-performance packet sniffer capable of real-time network traffic analysis.
- Ability to filter packets and collect network statistics efficiently.
- A user-friendly CLI tool with interactive monitoring features.

## **7. Future Enhancements**
- GUI-based visualization with Qt.
- Integration with intrusion detection systems.
- Remote monitoring and alerting capabilities.
